----------------------------------------------

In order to interact with web application we need to locate web elements so Selenium can interact with Web application.

In order to perform some action such as clicking, entering some text, we need to location the web element so selenium can perform the action on the web element.


We locate Web element using locators.

Locators:

What is locator?

Locator is way to identify elements on the page.
We use locators to locate web element in the Web page.


There 8 different type of locators in Selenium.

1. ID -> to locate web element by its id -> id="id value"

2. Name -> to locate web element by its name name="name value"

3. Class Name -> to locate web element by its class name -> class="classValue"

4. Link Text -> to locate web element by its link text -> <a>text</a>

5. Partial Link Text -> to locate web element by partial link text -> 
                       <a> link text </a>

6. Tag name -> to locate web element by tag name -> <div>, <li> <ul>

7. css selector -> to locate web element based on their styles and attribute

8. xpath -> to locate web element by xpath
   There are two types of xpath: Absolute xpath & Relative xpath


----------------------------------------------------------

Why do we need/use locator?
Before our Selenium automation code can perform some action on the web page such as click, enter some text etc.. , we need to locate the web element using 1 of 8/any of 8 locators and then selenium can perform the action on locate web element.


Web element anything that we see on the page.

How to locate web element using any of those 8 locate?

findElement(); -> this method is used to find and return a single web element
                  and the return type is WebElement. If it does not find the web element it will throw NoSuchaElementException.
                  If there more than one web element, it will find and return the first one.

syntax: WebElement anyName = driver.findElement(By.id("id value"));

findElement() method comes from WebDriver

click();  is used to click on Web element, like clicking with your mouth



-----------------------------------------------

Locating web element by ID is always recommended, because ID is usually is unique for that specific Web Element.


sendKeys("text"); -> this method takes String as parameter and enter/type 
                     text in input/text area /input box


Before using sendKeys("text") method we need to locate the input/filed and using this method to enter/type the text in it.

e.g inputElemtn.sendKeys("username");



getText(); this method is used to get the text of web element inner text ->
           e.g <a> text </a>

First we need to locate the web element and use this method to get its text 
as a String, the return type is String

getAttribute("attribute"); this method takes attribute as a parameter and returns its value as a String, return type is string
