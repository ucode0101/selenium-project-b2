Package name -> day_12_keyboard_actions_js_singleton

Today's topic:

Run test in Firefox & Safari
Basic authentication (how to handle basic authentication)
Action Class - Keyboard actions
JavaScript Executor

If we have time:
Singleton Design Pattern - Singleton Class
Config Reader Class & properties file

----------------------------------------------------------------

Running test in any browser works the same

Basic Authentication:
Some website/web applications might be protected by basic authentication.
To handle basic authentication you need to provide your username and password withing the URL to authenticate yourself.

Basic Auth/Authentication in handled by providing username and password withing the URL.



e.g -> https://admin:admin@www.practice-ucodeacademy.com/basic_auth

---------------------------------------------------


Action Class - Keyboard actions

Actions class allows us to perform advance mouse and keyboard actions, such as Right click (context click), hover over, drag and drop, scroll down/up, press keys and more


To hold/press any key using actions, you need to use:
keyDown(Keys.SHIFT) -> This method is used to pres/hold the given Keys

Whenever you use keyDown() method to perform some action, you have to release using keyUp() method, otherwise it keeps hold down the key (whatever key it was pressing/holding)


To perform any mouse or keyboard actions in Selenium, user Actions class

keyDown() & keyUp() methods are used to hold & release keys on your keyboard

--------------------------------------------------------

JavaScriptExecutor Interface:

JavaScriptExecutor allows us to execute javaScrip code in our Selenium.

Sometime we cannot interact with web element using selenium locator, or when we want to interact with page or web element.

For example when a web element is hidden, we cannot interact with it using selenium locators


To use JavaScriptExecutor we need to Cast WebDriver type to JavaScriptExecutor type.



syntax: JavaScriptExecutor js = (JavaScriptExecutor) driver;

js.executeScript("javaScript code", web element); -> this method takes javaScript code as a String and webElement and executes the javaScript code

Using JavaScriptExecutor we can perform clicking on element, getting the text of web element, scroll down/up and more


The most common way of using JavascriptExecutor is when the web element is hidden or there is something is interrupting to interact with that web element

Using JavaScriptExecutor, you can scroll down or up to specif web element
locate the element and use js to scroll up/down to where the web element is on the page


--------------------------------------------------------------

Singleton Design Pattern - Singleton Class


Singleton Design Pattern -> is to use a single instance of a class.

The whole idea of Singleton Design Pattern is to use one WebDriver instance for the whole project. We create a Driver class and create a private constructor to prevent creating an object from that class and we use one instance of WebDriver for the whole project.

.properties file -> configuration.properties file

The .properties file is used to store all the data that we need for testing
such as URL, browser, credential etc...
It is mainly used for configuration
We use this to configure the environment, store credentials, etc..
We store data in .properties file based on key & value


To create .properties file:

1. Right click on project name
2. New -> File -> file configuration.properties (extension i .properties)
3. store some data/information based on key & value
  e.g -> url="www.google.com"




Read/get the data from .properties file:

1. Create a java class -> ConfigurationsRead.java/ConfigReader.java

2. Create the path to the file

3. Create an object from Properties class

4. Open the file using FileInputStream

5. Load the file into the properties object

6. Read/get the values using getProperty() method




We create Singleton and ConfigReader class under the util package
