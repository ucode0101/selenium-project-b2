Dynamic Web element, Static Web element

--------------------------------------------------------


Dynamic Web element, Static Web element:

Dynamic Web Element -> when web element's values (attribute value) keeps changing, and it will hard to locate dynamic web element using any of 6 locator. We can use css sector or xpath to locate dynamic web element


Static Web element -> Web element's value (attribute value) doesn't change

There are 3 ways of locating Dynamic web element
Starts with -> if start value is static
Ends with  -> if end value is static
Contains -> if it contains some static value

If there are multiple result when you are locating web element by CSS Selector, you can use the following syntax to locate specified index element
e.g  -> button[onclick^='button']:nth-of-type(3)

To locate immediate child element in CSS:
Tag>tag>tag -> div>div>h3

To locate any child in CSS:

Tag tag -> div p


==============================================================================


XPath: -> XPath is defined as XML path

Xpath is one of the eight locators in Selenium that we use to locate web element.

There two type of XPath: -> Absolute and Relative XPath:

Absolute XPath starts with single forward slash / and we have to start from the very beginning /html:
e.g -> /html/body/div/div/div/div/div/h3



Relative XPath starts with double forward slash // and we can start from any tag with HTML DOM.

To locate Web Element using Relative XPath:

XPath Syntax: -> //tagName[@attributeName='attributeValue']

 CSS Selector -> tagName[attributeName='attributeValue']

Locate Web Element using XPath by known Value only

//tagName[@*='attributeValue']

Star (*) means ANY in xpath
We can replace TagName with Star (*) also

Locate Web Element using XPath by known Attribute 

//*[@attributeName='value'] e.g -> //*[@href='/multiple_buttons']

Even though we can use star (*) ANY for tag name or attribute name, it is better to use tag name and attribute name instead of using *

Locate Web Element by Visible text using XPath:

Two ways of locating web element by visible text using XPath:
1. using text() & no @ e.g  -> //tag[text()='text']
2. using dot (.) & no @ e.g -> //tag[.='text']


Even using CSS Selector or XPath you cannot locate the web element directly
Sometimes, you have to locate the web element and go to its sibling or go backward
